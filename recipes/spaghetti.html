        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Spaghetti (Italian: [spaˈɡetti]) is a long, thin, solid, cylindrical pasta. It is a staple food of traditional Italian cuisine. Like other pasta, spaghetti is made of milled wheat, water, and sometimes enriched with vitamins and minerals. Italian spaghetti is typically made from durum-wheat semolina. Usually the pasta is white because refined flour is used, but whole wheat flour may be added. Spaghettoni is a thicker form of spaghetti, while spaghettini is a thinner form. Capellini is a very thin spaghetti, sometimes known colloquially as "angel hair pasta", while Vermicelli refers to intermediate widths, varying between the United States and Italy.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Ground Beef</li>
            <li>Tomato sauce</li>
            <li>Diced tomatoes</li>
            <li>Tomato paste</li>
            <li>Beef broth</li>
            <li>Canned mushrooms</li>
            <li>A splash of wine</li>
            <li>Onion, celery, and fresh garlic</li>
            <li>Dried herbs, kosher salt, freshly ground black pepper, and a pinch of sugar for sweetness</li>
            <li>Dried whole cloves</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Brown the beef. Drain off any excess fat, then, throw in the chopped celery, onion, and garlic and cook until the vegetables soften.</li>
            <li>Boil and simmer. Dump the rest of the homemade pasta sauce ingredients into the pot and bring the mixture to a boil. Once boiling, reduce the heat and let it simmer on the stove for 3 hours. 3 hours sounds like forever, but that’s how long it takes to make a rich, flavorful meat sauce. Just do what the Italians do,  and fuhgetaboutit.</li>
            <li>Cook your noodles. Once the homemade spaghetti sauce has had time to simmer, all that’s left to do is boil the spaghetti noodles according to package instructions and dish it up!</li>
        </ol>
