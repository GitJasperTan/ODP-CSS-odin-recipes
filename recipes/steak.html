		<h2>Description</h2>
		<p>
			A steak is a thick cut of meat generally sliced across the muscle fibers, sometimes including a bone. It is normally grilled or fried. Steak can be diced, cooked in sauce, such as in steak and kidney pie, or minced and formed into patties, such as hamburgers.
			Steaks are cut from animals including cattle, bison, buffalo, camel, goat, horse, kangaroo, sheep, ostrich, pigs, turkey, and deer, as well as various types of fish, especially salmon and large fish such as swordfish, shark, and marlin. For some meats, such as pork, lamb and mutton, chevon, and veal, these cuts are often referred to as chops. Some cured meat, such as gammon, is commonly served as steak.

		<h2>Ingredients</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Ribeye Steak</li>
			<li>Salt</li>
			<li>Pepper</li>
			<li>Butter</li>
			<li>Rosemary</li>
			<li>Olive Oil</li>
			<li>Garlic</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Steps</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>Pat dry – use paper towels to pat the steaks dry to get a perfect sear and reduce oil splatter.</li>
			<li>Season generously – just before cooking steaks, sprinkle both sides liberally with salt and pepper.</li>
			<li>Preheat the pan on medium and brush with oil. Using just 1/2 Tbsp oil reduces splatter.</li>
			<li>Sear steaks – add steaks and sear each side 3-4 minutes until a brown crust has formed then use tongs to turn steaks on their sides and sear edges (1 min per edge).</li>
			<li>Add butter and aromatics – melt in butter with quartered garlic cloves and rosemary sprigs. Tilt pan to spoon garlic butter over steaks and cook to your desired doneness (see chart below).</li>
			<li>Remove steak and rest 10 minutes before slicing against the grain.</li>
